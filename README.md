# Number Guessing Game - C#

A structured console-based number guessing game built using C# and .NET.

## Overview

This application generates a random number within a selected difficulty range and challenges the user to guess it through an interactive console interface. The program provides real-time feedback on each guess (too high / too low), validates user input to prevent runtime errors, tracks the number of attempts, and allows the player to replay the game.

The project demonstrates clean program structure, method separation, and user-focused design in a console environment.

## Features

- Multiple difficulty levels (Easy / Medium / Hard)
- Random number generation within selected range
- Input validation using `int.TryParse`
- Continuous loop until the correct guess
- Real-time feedback (Too high / Too low)
- Attempt counter
- Replay functionality

## Technologies Used

- C#
- .NET Console Application
- Structured programming principles

## What I Learned

- Working with the `Random` class
- Control flow using loops and conditionals
- Input validation and error handling
- Method abstraction for cleaner code organization
- Improving user interaction in console applications
